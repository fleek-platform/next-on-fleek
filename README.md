  <p align="center">Build, develop, and deploy Next.js apps for Fleek Functions.</p>
</p>

`@fleek-platform/next-on-fleek` is a CLI tool that you can use to build and develop [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) applications so that they can run on [Fleek Functions](https://fleek.xyz/docs/platform/fleek-functions/).

This is a fork of the original [@cloudflare/next-on-pages](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages) project, with the goal of making it compatible with Fleek Functions, leveraging IPFS for static asset hosting.
